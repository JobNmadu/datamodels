abstract:
  This exploratory research was carried out with the objective of identifying the major reasons advanced by farmers for choosing among a host of crops which one to cultivate.  The method of disposal was also studied.  The data, which was collected using structured questionnaire, was analysed using Tables, percentages and chi-square. The findings indicated that out of the eighteen different crops being cultivated in this community as at the time of the survey, sorghum seems to be the most popular.  The choice hierarchy indicated that food security was a major objective among these farmers.  The implications of these findings were adequately discussed.
