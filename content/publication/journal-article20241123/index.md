abstract: 
 The importance of livelihood diversification cannot be over emphasized as it reduces risk by spreading income sources across different activities, households can mitigate risks associated with climate variability, market shocks, or other disruptions. While climate change adaptation is significant in enhancing agricultural productivity, reduces vulnerability and promote sustainable development. This research examined the various livelihood options and the intensity of use among farmers in North Central Nigeria. Original research using primary data collected from sampled farmers who are basically into production of rice and cassava. The study was conducted in North central Nigeria in 2023. The study used data obtained from administered questionnaire to 483 small scale farmers which were randomly selected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). AHP method where alternatives are compared with each other under various criteria is more accurate than cluster analysis which categorize households into distinct livelihood strategy groups based on the percentage contribution of individual income to the total household income and also the rating method using likert-type scale. Results revealed that all the farmers participated in crop farming with mean monthly income of N55,416.98 which has the highest priority weight of 22.14%. Other livelihood activities identified were livestock farming, petty trading, business, agricultural trading, aquaculture/artisanal fishing, agro-processing, handcraft, transportation services, tailoring/fashion design, health worker, telecommunication services, labour vending, artisans, blacksmith, domestic worker, construction worker and mining/quarry worker. Result of the AHP revealed that there was more intense use of crop farming among the livelihood options which was ranked first, then livestock farming, business and agricultural trading. The study concluded that crop farming was the most important livelihood activity of the farmers. The farmers have diversified to take advantage of available opportunities to improve their livelihood security, reduce risk and improve their adaptation to climate change.
