abstract:
 Excess maize (Zea mays) grains need to be stored in order to maintain constant supply all-year-round. However, most of the small scale farmers sell large proportion of their produce immediately after harvest when price is low due to high supply. In view of this, a study was conducted to identify the problems that prevent farmers from storing maize in Abuja. A multi-stage sampling technique was adopted while structured questionnaires were used for data collection. A total of 160 maize farmers were interviewed in four agricultural zones (40 farmers from each zone) of Abuja. Data obtained were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and mean separation was done at 5% probability level. Results showed that there was significant difference (P<0.05) in the perceptions of maize farmers regarding problems that militated against their desire to store part of their maize grains after harvest. The most limiting problem against maize storage was rodent attack (2.70) and the cost of storage materials (2.33). On the other hand, the least limiting problem to maize storage was fear of the quantity the household would consume if stored (0.74). In all the zones, Abuja East Agricultural Zone was the worst hit (1.95) in terms of the problems. Based on the findings, it is recommended that government and non-governmental agencies should embark on campaign to sensitize the farmers on the use of rodenticides and other cultural means of controlling rodents.
