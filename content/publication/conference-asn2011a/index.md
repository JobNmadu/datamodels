abstract:
  This study was undertaken to determine the input-output analysis of palm fruit processing by small scale processors in Aguata Area of Anambra State. In order to obtain the data for this research, 10 processors each from six villages that are involved in oil palm processing on a fairly large number of the population were purposively selected. Descriptive statistics such as mean, median and mode were used to describe the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents as wells as constraints. The profitability of the oil processing business was determined using the net farm income model. The level of efficiency of the various resources use in the palm fruit processing business were determined using the Average Physical Products method and regression model was used to determine the factors affecting palm oil output. The results obtained clearly indicated that the palm fruit processing activity is profitable (profit of 654,479.18) with GR of 0.87059619, VR of  0.788342412 and FR of 0.082253778. It s advocated that efforts should be made to ensure constant power for the processing enterprises while the processors are encouraged to form co-operatives to enable easy access to credit.
