abstract:
  This study investigated the Meta factors that accentuate farm size over a nine year period (2003-2011) using data obtained from final year projects report in Department of Agricultural Economics and Extension Technology, Federal University of Technology, Minna. The model was estimated through OLS on four functional forms. The result indicated that the variation of farm size was not adequately captured by the model although studies conducted in Zone 1 of Niger State and average farm income were found to give a higher and significant increase in farm size while data year and number of observations used in the base research are found to reduce farm size significantly. Farmers in other zones of Niger State as well as other parts of Nigeria should strive towards larger farm size and move towards commercialisation.
