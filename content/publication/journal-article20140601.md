abstract:
 The study examined the technical efficiency of 110 smallholder cassava farmers selected from two Local Government Areas in Kogi State, Nigeria. Descriptive statistics and stochastic frontier production function were used to analyze the primary data collected with the aid of a structured questionnaire. The maximum likelihood estimates showed that labour (0.5054), planting material (0.432) and land resource (0.1388) were the important production factors and directly related to cassava output. The parameters that increased technical efficiency are education, farming experience and extension contacts while age, membership of farmers’ group and household size reduced technical efficiency with mean technical efficiency of 0.9489 (94.89%). The estimates indicated that the farmer have not fully utilized the variable resources as the return to scale was 1.7724. The study concluded that there were still some levels of inefficiency of 0.0511 (0.5.11%) among the cassava farmer; and that the significant production and inefficient factors should be manipulated by the farmers and policy makers to increase the technical efficiency and invariably the output. Young and educated men and women should be encouraged to take up cassava production by providing them access to credit, improved varieties, farm mechanization implements and adequate extension services.
