abstract:
 A study was carried out in Bida area to find out the existing types and sources of information used by the farmers and to study the inter-relationship between types and sources of information on the one hand; and between types and sources and farmer category on the other. The assumption of the study was that types and sources of information used by farmers should be related to their literacy level. The data used in this study were collected directly from the farmers using structured questionnaire.  The farm managers were categorised into I and II. The Type I farm managers were those whose farms are located within the Federal Polytechnic, Bida campus while Type II farm managers were those whose farms are located around the campus. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, tables, t-ratio, chi-square and percentages. The findings indicate that crops grown and the objectives for growing them are unique to each crop. Also, sources and types of information were generally unique of one another and not farmer type-unique.  From the findings, it was concluded that farm managers, whether literate or not, look for similar information from similar sources.
