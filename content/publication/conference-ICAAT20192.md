abstract:
  This study was conducted in Niger State, Nigeria to analyze artisanal and cultured fish production in the state. The data for this study was collected using questionnaires and interview schedules from 100 and 80 randomly selected cultured fish farmers and artisanal fish farmers (fishermen) respectively. Descriptive and inferential statistics were mainly used for the analysis. The results of the study revealed that majority of the respondents (69.4%) were still in their active and productive age and a large proportion (75.6%) were married and a moderate household size of between 4-6 persons. Also majority (69.4%) had one form of education or the other. The result shows that majority of the respondents (53.33%) were on the extra-large (above 15,000fishes) scale of production and fish produced from artisanal fishing (mean=16377 fishes) was greater than the fish produced by cultured fish farming (14216 fishes). The result shows that marital status, age and years of fishing experience were significant socio-economic factors that affect the level of fish production. Fish productions were faced with many problems such as depletion of fish stocks for the artisanal production and poor source of fingerlings for the cultured production. It is recommended that Government and NGOs should train the fishermen on artisanal fishing to stop over-exploitation/indiscriminate catch of wild fish and also training on how to domesticate the wild catches so as to increase production.
