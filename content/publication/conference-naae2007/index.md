abstract:
  This study was carried out to determine the effect of fertilizer and some socio-economic factors on total output of yam in Kabba Bunu Local Government Area of Kogi State, Nigeria during the 2005/2006 farming season. To achieve this aim, a structured questionnaire was administered to sixty (60) randomly selected farmers out of which six (6) were returned unfilled. Results obtained shows that fertilizer has no significant effect on the output of Yam. This may be due to a combination of high cost and lack of adequate financial power to purchase optimum amount needed to affect yam output. However, farm size, age, credit and family size are found to have significant effect on the output of Yam. It is recommended that farmers should be adequately empowered to purchase enough fertilizer in order to ensure optimum and sustainable yam production and meet up with the millennium development goals of eliminating hunger and extreme poverty.
