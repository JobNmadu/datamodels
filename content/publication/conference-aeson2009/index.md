abstract:
  This study investigated the willingness of maize farmers to adopt improved maize technologies. The findings indicate that farmers show willingness to adopt technologies that are similar to their traditional practice. Farmers must be properly informed of the benefits of extension services and extension agents must be well trained and motivated as extension services become demand-driven.
