abstract:
 The study investigated the Demand analysis for consumer preference of cowpea attributes in Niger State, Nigeria. The study employed a multistage stratified and systematic random sampling to select markets and respondents for the study. Markets selected were Kontagora market in (production region), Sabon Wuse market in Tafa (transitory region) and Minna market in (consumption region).Time series data for the price/quality information were obtained from respondents in these markets. Cowpea samples were purchased every month from five (5) systematically, randomly selected retailers in each market for 12 months. Data were analyzed using the Hedonic model. Findings from the study revealed that consumers were willing to pay a premium for additional unit of grain weight at NGN0.96; rough testa texture at NGN40.64 and white eye color at NGN21.42 and NGN11.90 from different markets estimated. On the other hand consumers were ready to discount prices for bruchid/insect hole damage at NGN1.00, white testa color in Kontagora market at NGN17.73; NGN40.90 in Sabon Wuse market and NGN46.66 in Minna market. Recommendations from this study included the need for the provision of better storage media such as the triple hermatic storage sacks, to market participants to reduce the number of insect infested beans. Most preferred qualities of cowpea such as grain weight, rough testa texture and white eye color should be disseminated to breeders to come up with varieties encompassing these qualities.
