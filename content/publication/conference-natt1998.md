abstract:
  The possibility of embarking on small scale production of Zobo drink to enhance family income is discussed in this paper. The paper highlights that an annual gross income of between N374,400 and N1,560,000.00 is possible with an expected gross margin of between N158,184 and N839,280. The total initial capital required to commence production is N33,750.00. This shows that Zobo production is highly profitable and can easily enhance family income.
