abstract:
  Agricultural planning involves the act of estimating future costs and expected returns if production is undertaken while asset control is the process of determining the economic value of the farm's assets and liabilities in order to justify their continued ownership or otherwise.  These two processes are necessary in order to ensure that the farm business makes profit and remains in business for a long time.  They also aid executive decision-making and are invaluable in any farm business organization because they are attributes of financial success.  Agricultural production, unlike manufacturing, takes time for benefits to be reaped and any mistake may lead to total failure hence there is need to make proper plan and take adequate control measures.  Also, adequate control of farm assets or liabilities is needed to prepare final accounts (balance sheet and profit and loss accounts).  There are many planning and control tools, but each has its assumption and limitations.  One of the versatile tools used in agricultural planning and which is consistent with the small scale farming nature of Nigeria is LINEAR PROGRAMMING, while one of the key control technique for farm assets is proper asset management through continuous depreciation and revaluation.  Because of the tedious nature of the calculations involved in planning and control, there is need to have a device that can assist.  The device is also needed in order to improve efficiency and accuracy. This forms the basis for this paper.  This paper reports on two computer programs written in BASIC, which can aid in carrying out farm planning and effective control.  The programs have been tested on standardized data and are currently running on a Microsystem.  The sample runs are provided in the appendix
