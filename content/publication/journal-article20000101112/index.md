abstract:
 This paper reports on a computer program of a very effective tool of farm planning-LINEAR PROGRAMMING. The program (LP96) was written in BASIC and is currently running on a microcomputer. The basic hardware required to implement this program is an IBM PC or compatible with enhanced graphic adapter (EGA). A printer is also needed if a hard copy of the output is needed.
