abstract:
 Secondary data, estimated with Nerlovian adaptive expectation and partial adjustment models, were used to compute planned and achieved acreage as well as expected price of sorghum in Nigeria for the period 1961 to 1997. Results show that there was no convergence between the factors studied due to conflict in policies adopted by the authorities. Also, there has not been commensurate increase in sorghum acreage because the increase in the cost of inputs outweighed the increase in the price of sorghum. The critical inputs that need attention in sorghum production are seed, labour and fertilizer. Policy actions, which will increase supply and reduce cost of production and enhance self-sufficiency by 2010, have been advocated.
