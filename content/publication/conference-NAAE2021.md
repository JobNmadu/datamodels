abstract:
  The study analyzed factors that influence farmers‘ access to extension services in the study area. The study utilized data obtained from 483 farmers with the use of interview schedule questionnaire. The data were analyzed using vtree and Double hurdle regression model. The results revealed that 80% of the respondents are male with moderate adaptive capacity to climate change. In addition, farmers, with high adaptive capacity to climate change had higher level of education. Result of the double hurdle regression revealed that farmer‘s adaptive capacity to climate change, being a male, farm income, non-farm income, being poor, availability of social amenities, membership of association and increase in the distance of farmer‘s farm from the village had significant positive influence of number of extension services received by farmers with contacts. While ratio of livelihood activities, farm size, age, level of education, distance of farm to market, credit, livestock ownership, household size and working household members had significant negative influence on number of extension services received by farmers with contact. Furthermore, result of the zero-contact revealed that the odds can be increased by adaptive capacity to climate change, farm size, gender, credit, household size, poverty status, availability of social amenities and membership of association. While ratio of livelihood activities, livestock ownership and farming experience can decrease extension contact. It was there for recommended that extension agents should assist in increasing the adaptive capacity of the farmers by incorporating more climate change related techniques and adaptation strategies in their services, availability of functional social amenities should be a major focus when formulating policies and developmental issues as it influences extension services and farmers should be encourage to form associations so as to achieve the benefits associated with it.
