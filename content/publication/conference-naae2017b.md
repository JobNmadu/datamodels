abstract:
  The study examined the profitability of maize/sorghum based cropping enterprises in Niger State, Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed for selecting the respondents and data were collected using structured questionnaires from a total of 360 maize/sorghum based farming households sampled from nine Local Government Areas across the three agricultural zones of the State. Descriptive statistics and farm budgeting technique were used to analyze the data for the study. Results revealed that a typical maize/sorghum based crop farmer cultivated average of 2.36 hectares, with less than 10% of these planted with maize and sorghum as sole or mono-crops. The profitability analysis indicate that returns from sole maize cropping enterprise is the lowest but combinations of maize with other crops tends to yield higher returns. Across the State, NGN1.35, NGN1.58 and NGN1.31 was realized for every NGN1.00 invested in production of maize/sorghum cropping enterprises by farmers in Zone I, Zone II, Zone III of Niger State agricultural zones respectively. The net farm income/ha was NGN36,735.44 with an average gross margin/ha of NGN38,378.41 was realized by the maize/sorghum based farmers. The gross ratio of 0.44 and the operating ratio of 0.40 are indicators that maize/sorghum based cropping enterprises was profitable. The study recommended that farmers should be enlightened on the higher returns in investment and profitability of cultivating maize and sorghum in combination and with other crops through effective extension and farm advisory services to enhance farmers' incomes and livelihoods thereby curb the incidences of widespread hunger, unemployment and poverty.
