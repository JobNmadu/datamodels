abstract: 
 The goal of this study is to determine the impact of HIV/AIDS infection on the socio-economic profiles of the farmers in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State. The study used survey data to describe the socio economic characteristics of the households, the infection status of the households, the labour input of households in farm activities, the income of the households and the poverty level of the households. Data were also analysed using the Foster Greer Thorbecke metric equation for poverty. The result shows that the farm enterprise is family based and the predominant tenure system is by inheritance. Also, 17% of the respondents and 18% of the households were infected with the disease although there likelihood that the number is under-reported since another 28% of the respondents were not too confident of their status. There was 30% rise in medical expenditure and 30% fall in annual income of those suffering from the disease. In view of the fore-going, it is recommended that there is need to transit the farming enterprise from family-based to commercial venture as envisioned in the agricultural transformation agenda. In addition, farm support infrastructure, like access roads, farm gate markets, and easy access to modern farm equipment encourage commercialisation. The government should ensure that voluntary testing is enhanced and those living with HIV are supported in every way possible especially by subsidizing the cost of treatment and reducing stigmatization.
