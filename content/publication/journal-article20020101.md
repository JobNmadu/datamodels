abstract:
 This paper reports on simple software developed in BASIC language to aid farm managers in analysis of farm records and diagnosis of farm problems with the aid of a computer. The program is currently running on a PC. The program requires a PC with any version of BASIC (preferably QBASIC) installed. Although written in BASIC, the program can be translated into FORTRAN and other high-level language if and when desired. The flow chart and some sample runs are provided.
