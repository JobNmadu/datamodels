abstract:
  This study examined the factors that affect farm labour supply and utilisation for food crop production in Niger state, Nigeria. The data were collected from 180 participants of Fadama II in Katcha and Agaie LGAs and analysed using descriptive statistics and 2SLS regression model. The result shows that majority of the farm labour suppliers were within the ideal age distribution in the rural society of Africa and that family and hired labour are major source of the farm labour supply in the study area. Result from the 2SLS analysis confirm that variables such as income, migrated farm labour supplier, agro-chemical, household size, wage rate, farm size, and gender were statistically significant. However the level of farm/family income, high wage rate, age composition of family, lack of timely/adequate supply of labour and, aging of farm labour suppliers were identified as important constraints affecting farm labour supply and utilisation for food crop production. It is recommended that regulation of farm wage rate should be pursued in order to ensure that farm operations are carried in time at optimum cost.
