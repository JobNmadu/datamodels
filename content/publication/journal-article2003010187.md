abstract:
 Sorghum acreage was modelled by incorporating varying coefficients of expectation in the adaptive expectation framework following the method of Phillip (1988). The data used covered the period 1961 to 1997. It was found that, although the multiple coefficient of determination was very high, the associated error measures indicate that sorghum acreage did not respond to price adequately. The negative levels of the estimated supply elasticities further demonstrate this fact. It therefore means that sorghum production has not been done commercially hence all the production in the past were mainly for meeting the food needs of the family.
