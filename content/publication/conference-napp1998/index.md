abstract:
  Investigations were carried out to evaluate the profitability of using neem seed extract (NSE) to control cowpea pest at Bida (9.06N and 5.59E) during the 1994 and 1995 cropping seasons.  The results obtained were compared with the performance of a conventional agrochemical-nuvacron.  Results obtained 1995 show that there were significant difference between the yields obtained from the two control methods at 5% level of significance.  Also 3.33% w/v of NSE and 0.2% v/v of nuvacron gave best yields of 712.60 kg/ha and  1165 kg/ha respectively.  These results translate to gross margin of N10,993.19 and N19,637.99 respectively. Similar results were obtained during the 1996 cropping season.
