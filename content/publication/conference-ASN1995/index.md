abstract:
  This study examined the socio-economic characteristics of farmers in Pati, Lavun Local Government Area of Niger State.  Questionnaires were administered to 38 farmers randomly selected from the nine villages to generate the data.  The data was analysed using means, percentages, frequency distribution and charts.  The major findings indicate that the average age of the household heads sampled is 48 years with a family size of seven.  The household heads were all farmers with an average farm size of 2.16ha held in three or four fragments around the settlements; but some of them have some non-farm occupations in addition.  The farms are located within an average distance of 2.482km and takes about 0.69 hours to trek from house to the farm thus giving an average speed of 3.60km/hr.  It was also found that family labour is utilised more on nearby farms while hired labour ten to be utilised on far away farms.  It is suggested that farmers should have access to land as much as required at one location.
