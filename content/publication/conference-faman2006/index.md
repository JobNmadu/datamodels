abstract:
  The effect of changes in the marketing system and oil economy in Nigeria on sorghum output, acreage and yield between 1961 and 2005 was investigated.  The result shows that there are signs of both growth and retardation during the periods under study.  The average rates of growth were 1.58% for output, 1.42% for acreage and -0.16% for yield translating to doubling time of 25 years for output, five years for acreage and 13 years for yield.  Acceleration, stagnation and deceleration were also observed at different sub-periods for the variables.  It was indicated that sorghum technology must grow at a rate that will ensure food security for Nigeria not later than 2015.
