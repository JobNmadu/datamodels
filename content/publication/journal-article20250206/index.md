abstract: 
 Analyzing mediating and non-mediating factors influencing cooperative membership among couples and non-couples in addition to addressing gaps in understanding motivations and barriers so as to provide insights for tailored policies and effective cooperative models to enhance economic status and social well-being was the focus of this study. The study was conducted in six Nigerian states in 2023. Six Nigerian states were randomly selected to collect data from 820 farmers using structured questionnaires. Analytical techniques employed included descriptive statistics, factor analysis, structural equation and bivariate recursive models. The study revealed that adult-male-cooperative members outnumber non-members across all states which suggest wide gender disparities. Regional variations in gender disparities in cooperative membership also exist stressing the need for inclusive policies and targeted programs for youth and elderly. Significant driving factors identified at 1% levels of significance included commitment, transparency, economic status, and employee efficiency. On the other hand, significant constraints affecting participation included inadequate infrastructure, poor communication, and limited education. Distance to cooperative meetings (average=7.61km) is negative, indicating a lower likelihood of increasing membership but does not impact on off-farm participation in the short and long run. Recursive logit and probit models reveal long-term impacts, stressing the importance of careful intervention design and policy planning. Varying prediction of cooperative membership benefits, especially for non-couples, emphasize the need for complementary geographical and longitudinal studies, but off-farm activities show potential long-term negative effects. Robust cooperative institutions effectively linked to off-farm participation require improved infrastructure, access to education, corporate governance and sound financial management.
