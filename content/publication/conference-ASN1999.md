abstract:
  Common econometric models used for estimation were used to estimate models for forecasting world sorghum.  Results show that the semilog model gave the best result followed by linear model.  The growth or exponential model gave the poorest result. In addition, it was discovered that there is no loss of generality in the estimation with or without trend, although, for forecasting purposes, it was retained.  The result can easily be extended to other crops and services.
