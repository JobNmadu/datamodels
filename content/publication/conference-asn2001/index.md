abstract:
  The structural characteristic of income is a very important index of development, for it indicates how evenly (or otherwise) income is distributed among a set of people in focus.  Policies, programs and projects are put in place to redistribute income and promote higher food production and greater food security.  One of such programs is the community banking system.  A study was conducted to determine the distribution of income among borrowers and non-borrowers of Bejin-Doko Community Bank.  Forty-one borrowers and 49 non-borrowers were interviewed using structured questionnaire.  The data was analysed using means, percentages and Gini coefficient.  Results show that income is not evenly distributed both among borrowers and non-borrowers.  A major policy direction has been advocated in the paper.
