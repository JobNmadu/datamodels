abstract:
 This paper reports on software capable of carrying out analysis of variance (ANOVA) using any of the three complete blocks and four split plot experimental designs. The software was prepared using BASIC but may easily be translated into other high languages if desired. The output, which is saved directly to users file, includes the complete ANOVA table, the various interaction means, Rp values and LSD values. The interaction means is useful for mean separation if needed with the aid of the Rp values.
