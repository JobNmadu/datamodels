abstract:
 Because of the market reforms being undertaken in many countries, a study was carried out among small scale farmers in the Niger Inland Valley to access farmers response to these reforms. The data were generated using a structured questionnaire. The farmers were categorised into those who took agricultural loan from Bejin-Doko Community Bank, Doko during the 1995/96 farming season and those who did not. An analysis of the data using regression techniques indicates that only very few economic factors influence farm size. It is concluded that market reforms have not affected land size in any appreciable way.
