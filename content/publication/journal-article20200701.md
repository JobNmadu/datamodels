abstract:
 'Globally, extreme weather is predicted to become more common on animals, plants and crops, which are all expected to be badly affected. In Nigeria, the effects of climate change are expected not to stop at just affecting the agricultural production, it will surely affect the lives and overall development of the country. This study factors influencing farmers' adaptive capacities to climate change in Edo and Kogi states. Descriptive statistics and ordered logit model were the analytical tools used. Results of the analyses reveal that gender, types of accommodation changes, sanitation, visit to hospital, amount spent on treatment, education and irrigation were the major factors influencing adaptation capacity to climate change in the study. The study recommends that Policy makers should provide basic amenities for respondents residing along river Niger communities, such as health care Centre's, markets, as well as access to farm land, to reduce challenges of income spent on travelling distance by respondents'.
