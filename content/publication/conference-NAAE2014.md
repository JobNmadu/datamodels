abstract:
  This study examined the dynamics of poverty and food security in using data obtained from a 2 staged sampling of 108 households in Minna Niger state. Data was analysed through the use of descriptive statistics, Food Security Index, Foster, Greer and Thorbecke and the ordinary least square regression. The result indicated that the household heads were mostly (98.1%) men that were married (78.7%). Also, the results revealed that the household had access to food 2 to 3 times daily and majority (67.6% and 84.3%)of the households were food secured and lived below the poverty line respectively. The regression results revealed that poverty in the study area was influenced by the food security status of the household P<.0.01, educational level P<.0.05 and working experience P<.0.1. The study therefore recommends that mass literacy programmes should be introduced and encouraged and also programmes targeted at reducing food insecurity and poverty should be intensified in order to further increase the number of people that are food secured and live above the poverty line.
