abstract:
  The study investigated whether socio-cultural factors accentuate technical efficiency of yam farmers in Kogi State, Nigeria in addition to the socio-economic normally postulated. Primary data collected from 180 yam farmers randomly selected from three local government areas, one from each of the socio-cultural group of the State was used. Results indicated that there is more number of socio-cultural factors that determine the level of technical efficiency of yam farmers than the socio-economic. The results further show that male farmers are more affected by socio-cultural factors than female. In addition, the Okuns seems to be more affected while the Igalas were least affected. However, some of the socio-cultural practices are shrouded in some form of secrecy and research effort should be geared towards empirical understanding of their operation. Yam farmers should be provided with more comprehensive and adequate extension support to manage their farms in line with modern and improved production technologies, rather than basing their production decisions on factors alien to modern agricultural production.
