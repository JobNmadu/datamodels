abstract:
 This study seeks to describe the socio-economic characteristic of the respondents in the study area, describe the land tenure systems operational in the study area, determine the trend in farm size change in the study area over a period of five years, determine the trend in Land supply to the market in the last five years and determine the land tenure system that is dynamic in land supply to agricultural production. The cross-sectional study in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Extension Technology, Federal University of Technology, Minna, Nigeria, between January and July, 2012. The study investigated the manner and strategies adopted in acquisition and management of land resources for agricultural production in Benue State, Nigeria. A sample of 80 respondents was selected for the study through simple random sampling technique and data were collected from them using a structured questionnaire.It was found that a greater per cent (48.75%) of the respondent acquired land through inheritance indicating that no change has taken place in method of land acquisition over the years. This also underscores the near absence of land markets in most states of Nigeria. The size of holding continues to be small (<=5.58ha) which has not accentuated the commercialization of agriculture in Nigeria. The sale and purchase of land is done in a mix of market situation like exchange of farm produce, cash and other socio-cultural methods. The study recommends that policies and agricultural programmes in Nigeria should take into cognizance the existing land tenure systems and the problems that emanate from them. In addition, problems associated with small sized farms and dispersal of holdings can be resolved through a method of land reform in which the fragments are accumulated together and the land is shared among owners so that each personâ€™s holding is in one location.
