abstract: Although a number of researchers have outlined the strategies farmers adopt to ensure stability of family income yet literature provides less understanding on the dynamic relationship between vulnerability to climate change, livelihood diversification, perception on climate change and income of the farmers. It is therefore the aim of this study to establish the relationship between these concepts. Study Design: Original research. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in North Central Nigeria in 2019. Multi-stage sampling technique was employed in the collection of primary data for this study. In the first stage, two (2) States were randomly selected from North Central Nigeria. In the second stage, five (5) Local Government Areas (LGAs) were randomly selected from the selected States, giving a total of ten (10) LGAs. In the third stage, sampling of farm households in each community were determined proportionately using Krejcie and Morgan (1970) formula. Data were collected from 483 farm households via questionnaire administered by trained enumerators. The data were analyzed using adaptive capacity index, vulnerability index and seemingly unrelated regression. Result of the seemingly unrelated regression revealed that increase in the number of livelihood activities and income of the farmer reduces vulnerability to climate change. More so, increase in the income of the farmer increases the number of livelihood activities the farmer engaged in and also increases the perception of the farmer on climate change. Farmers should diversify their sources of livelihood so as to reduce their vulnerability and improve resilience to climate change. The level of literacy among farm households and availability of social amenities should be looked into when formulating policies and developmental issues as they reduce vulnerability to climate change. Financial institutions should help facilitate access to credit by farmers so as to stimulate the adoption of climate smart practices.
