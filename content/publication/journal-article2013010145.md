abstract:
 The study analysed the determinants of awareness of credit procurement procedures and farmers income in Minna Metropolis, Niger State. A total of 90 farmers were randomly sampled from six villages around Minna Metropolis. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain data from the respondents in the study area. Descriptive statistics and three stage least square estimate were used to determine the relationship between farmers' socio economics factors, utilization of credit and total value of output, amount of credit procured and awareness of credit procurement procedures. The result appears t o suggest s that older farmers are not keen on available agricultural credit and tend to run the farm enterprise as a social enterprise. In view of this, and in order to reposition agriculture, farmers have to be enlightened to run their farm enterprise as a business and procure credit in order to increase the capital investment in the farm enterprise.
