  The study investigated the risk source and risk management practices among yam farmers in shiroro local government area of Niger State, Nigeria. A sample of 92 respondents was selected for the study through simple random sampling technique and data were collected using a structured questionnaire. It was found that a greater per cent of the respondent are faced with the problem of poor storage facilities, diseases, and poor market which makes them to adopt strategies like off-farm income generation, membership of association, and adoption of new technology. The study also reveals that soil management techniques, use of advanced storage facilities, membership of association, access to credit, and risk index were efficient with mean efficiency level of 0.842. The study recommends that infrastructural facilities such as good road network, and improved storage facilities. Extension programme should be improved on, and use of improved seedlings should be encouraged among farmers in the study area.
