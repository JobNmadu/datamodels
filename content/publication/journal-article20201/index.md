abstract: Although a number of studies have been carried out on climate change but the levels of vulnerability of farmers and factors affecting vulnerability of the farmers to this topical issue have not been sufficiently determined in the study area, giving rise to this study. The study was conducted in Benue and Niger States involving 483 IFAD-VCDP farmers. A total of 500 questionnaires were distributed, however only 96.6% were completed and returned. As such the data analysis was based on 483 farmers under International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) ? Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP) from 10 participating Local Government of the two States. Both primary and secondary data were utilized for this study. The primary data were collected via questionnaire administered by trained enumerators, while the secondary data were collected from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET). The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, vulnerability index and Beta regression model. The farmers were aware of eighteen climate change variables with assorted levels of occurrences. There was moderate vulnerable to climate change in the study area necessitating the need of enhanced awareness and capacity building to upgrade their homegrown adaptation strategies. Poverty status (3.0) was found to increase vulnerability while adaptive capacity (-23.8), age (-0.1), education (-0.7), gender (-2.8), distance to market (-0.1), livestock ownership (-0.4), social amenities (-1.9), total livelihood activities (-2.4) and membership of association (-3.8) decreased vulnerability by the percentages indicated in parenthesis. The study therefore recommended that the level of literacy among farm households and availability of social amenities should be critical issues when formulating climate adaptation policies and developmental issues. Government and NGOs should install processes that can enhance the adaptive capacity of the farmers.
