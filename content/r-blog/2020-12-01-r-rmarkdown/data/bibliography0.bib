abstract = {Using cross-sectional data and a propensity score matching technique, this paper investigates the impact of cooperatives on adoption of agricultural technologies. Our analysis indicates that cooperative members are more likely to be male-headed households, have better access to agricultural extension services, possess oxen, participate in off-farm work, and have leadership experience. We also found that geographic location and age of household head are strongly associated with cooperative membership. Our estimation results show that cooperative membership has a strong positive impact on fertilizer adoption. The impact on adoption of pesticides turns out to be statistically significant when only agricultural cooperatives are considered. Further analysis also suggests that cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on fertilizer adoption among its members. The results suggest that cooperatives can play an important role in accelerating the adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Across time and space at different scales. It is less meaningful to aggregate vulnerability across scales since the processes that cause vulnerability are different at each scale. We have explored issues of aggregation and construction of indices, weighting of indicators, and the efficacy of these to explain observed vulnerability to weather-related natural disasters. We are now in a better position to identify robust and transparent indicator sets. We find that national level adaptive capacity is dependent on social infrastructure and the accountability of institutions more than on the level of economic activity. OBJECTIVES The goals of the project have been: to operationalise a database on quantitative socio-economic indicators of vulnerability to climate change, classified by particular categories of climate impact; to address two processes which shape vulnerability that we consider to have been inadequately studied in previous work: health status and social capital; to address the relationship between the indicators and theoretical models of adaptation relevant for incorporation into global integrated assessment models; and, to seek co-funding for expansion of the health and other components of the work.},

abstract = {The study evaluated small-scale maize farmers access to farm inputs in Abuja, Nigeria because one of the most limiting factors in the development of agriculture in Nigeria is inadequate access to farm inputs. To cover the study area, a multi-stage sampling technique was adopted while structured questionnaires were used for data collection. A total of 160 maize farmers were interviewed in four agricultural zones (40 farmers from each zone). Data were analysed using mixed factorial analysis of variance; mean separation was carried out at the 5 percent probability level. The results showed that maize farmers access to the different types of farm input differed significantly (p {\textless} .05). Of all the farm inputs, land was the most accessible with a mean access value of 3.03 while the least accessible farm inputs were tractor services (0.64) and loans (0.58). Furthermore, the location of the farmers in Abuja had a significant (p {\textless} .05) interaction effect on farmers access to farm inputs. On the contrary, there were no significant differences (p {\textgreater} .05) in the mean responses of the maize farmers in the four different agricultural zones with respect to access to farm inputs. Generally, the grand mean access value (1.73) indicated that the maize farmers had poor access to all the farm inputs. Based on the grand mean access value, it was concluded that access to the farm inputs was poor; hence it was recommended that Input and Farm Information Service Centres should be established under a public-private partnership to increase farmers access to inputs, especially the most limiting inputs.},

abstract = {Nigeria is one of the developing countries facing shortages of cereal crops like maize. Based on this, research on the socio-economic factors influencing small-scale maize fanners output was conducted in Abuja. A multi-stage sampling technique and semi-structured questionnaire were used for data collection. A total of 160 maize fanners were interviewed in four agricultural zones (40 from each zone). Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis and descriptive statistics. The results showed that the land area cultivated, land rent, quantity of fertilizer applied, years of farming experience and household size were the major socio-economic factors that significantly (p  {\textless}  .05) influenced maize output. The R 2  value of 0.31 (adjusted R 2  = 0.26) indicated that the variables accounted for 31 percent of the variation in maize output. The mean outputs of maize per hectare and per farmer were 316.73 kg and 614.56 kg, respectively. Socio-economic results showed that the mean age of the fanners was 39 years with a substantial percentage (68.12{\%}) of them having, at most, primary school education. Based on the results, it was recommended that farmers in the study area should be informed through extension services of the socio-economic factors that influence maize output so that the farmers can consider these factors in their production decision making process.},

abstract = {The way a household copes with and withstands economic shocks depends on the options available, in terms of capabilities, assets (including both material and social resources) and activities. A livelihood strategy is the way those options are arranged and selected. Comprehending the driving factors of each livelihood strategy is crucial to improve the response mechanisms related to poverty and food security in developing countries. This paper aims to measure empirically the outcomes of different livelihoods strategies in terms of household resilience to food insecurity in the specific context of Kenyan households. Kenyan households are classified according to their own livelihood strategies by using the Ward's cluster analysis technique on data from the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey 2005-06. The information on shares of income sources, productive assets and occupational activities have been used to allow the data to identify the most meaningful and homogeneous groupings of Kenyan households in terms of livelihood strategies: pastoralist, agro-pastoralist, smallholder farmers, largeholder farmers, entrepreneurs and wage-employees. In order to understand the key determinants of each livelihood strategy and compare different livelihood strategies, we used and updated the resilience analysis framework developed by Alinovi et al. (2008). Comparing resilience by livelihood clusters in the eight provinces of Kenya shows there are significant differences across provinces and among clusters. Nairobi is by far the most resilient province and Eastern province the least one. Moreover, the large-holder farmers' cluster is the most resilient, whilst the pastoralist is the least resilient. However, the determinants of resilience are different for each livelihood group. Those differences are relevant in terms of policy implications, considering the differences between the ultimate determinants of each component. In terms of access to basic services, for example, access to credit is much more relevant to pastoralists and large-holders than it is to others. Access to water is more relevant to both farmer groups and agro-pastoralists, while access to electricity and telephone networks is relevant to entrepreneurs and wage-employees. The social safety-nets (transfers per capita) for wage-employees are twice those of other groups: this is related to urban poverty, where the lack of other assets (land, livestock, etc.) dramatically reduces the urban poor coping capacity.},

abstract = {Specialty crops have become increasingly important relative to other categories of agricultural production in the United States over the past 50 years, especially during the past 25 years. The growth in the value of production of specialty crops has not been matched by commensurate growth in public agricultural research spending. The specialty crops' share of spending on crops research (or on all agricultural research) has remained approximately constant during a period when the specialty crops' share of the value of production has increased significantly. This article reviews trends in the economic importance of specialty crops, and public funding for specialty crops research, and examines arguments and evidence about whether the total funding for specialty crops research is too little and whether the share of agricultural research funding allocated to specialty crops should increase. Although the evidence is mixed, we conclude that specialty crops research is underfunded and that a case can be made for increasing the share of agricultural research funding going to specialty crops. A producer check-off program with a matching government grant could be developed to give incentives to both the industry and the government to help enhance research funding.},

abstract = {Social structure, especially in the form of social networks, affects the adoption of agricultural technologies. In light of an increasing focus on new demand-driven agricultural extension approaches that leverage social networks as an opportunity, too little is known about (a) which network characteristics matter? and (b) how do specific network characteristics matter?. This paper uses survey data from Ethiopia to investigate the impact of social networks on smallholder dairy production technology adoption. Combined social network analysis and economic approaches is used to analyze dairy production adoption that incorporates social learning. Results reveal that smallholders acquire knowledge about improved dairy practices mainly from the public extension system (extension network), and to a lesser extent through their close associates (peer networks). On the other hand the study shows that the potential contributions of community and market networks that can significantly affect adoption remain untapped. Given the adoption of agricultural production technologies as an essential means of boosting productivity, increase production and improving incomes of smallholder households, these results indicate that technology-promoters may have to change their approach and focus on the innovative use of all kinds of social networks as an important determinant. In addition, this finding sheds light to design suitable strategies that leverage social networks to promote more rapid adoption of agricultural technologies by smallholders.

abstract = {Lao PDR has been relatively successful in raising incomes and reducing poverty since the early 1990s. However, the gains in terms of poverty reduction are unevenly distributed across regions and population groups. This paper uses a detailed household survey data set to examine the determinants of income and poverty in Lao PDR. The results suggest that household size, dependency ratios, education, and access to agricultural inputs are among the main determinants of per capita consumption. In addition, geography and ethnicity matter. A closer analysis of the role of ethnicity suggests that the higher poverty incidence among minority households is due to their limited access to productive resources rather than lower efficiency in resource use. The paper also proposes some elements for a poverty reduction strategy for Lao PDR.},

abstract = {Northern Ghana is noted for perennial low and varying agricultural production and this is manifest by persistent vulnerability of inhabitants (mostly farmers) to food insecurity. The low agricultural production has been linked to $\backslash$neffects of climate change. New technologies and cultivation practices aimed at enabling farmers to maximise their production to reduce risks associated with changes in climatic conditions in agriculture have been introduced in Northern Ghana. The nagging question is ‘“what influences the adaptive capacities of farmers to innovations introduced to them with the advent of climate variability'? This study has therefore been motivated by the interest in $\backslash$nfinding the determinants of adaptive capacity of farmers to various innovations targeted at adaptation to climate change and variability. The influence of education on the adaptive capacity of farmers to dugout construction and improvement suggest education will only make a difference for those with low adaptive capacity. This result, which also holds for the innovation on organic matter and composting, suggests that there is a threshold below which education or access to financial services exerts a positive influence on a farmer's adaptive capacity. Technology $\backslash$nappears to widen the gap between the different adaptive capacity categories of farm households. $\backslash$n},

abstract = {There is an expanding literature on multidimensional poverty measurement. Even though the theoretical foundations of the field are well developed, there are only a few empirical papers on developing countries, especially on the comparison of different measures. This paper applies a decomposable multidimensional measure developed by Alkire and Foster (2007) to a cross-sectional dataset on South Africa. This measure allows for decomposition of final outcome into the dimensions used. Furthermore, South Africa provides an interesting case study as the country is renowned for its high income-inequality rate. The contribution of the paper is to draw significant policy implications when a decomposable multidimensional measure is used as opposed to measures that are either multidimensional but not dimensionally decomposable or unidimensional. Specifically, it evaluates the current policy-making mechanism in South Africa at the provincial level and suggests alternative revenue-allocation schemes by using the Alkire–Foster measure.},

@article{BatzF.-J.abDresrusse2000,
abstract = {In the past, technological progress in Sub-Saharan Africa was not sufficient to meet the rapidly increasing demand for food. Although innovations developed by research may have a high technical performance they are either not adopted or are not properly used by the African smallholders. Apart from their complex farming systems, structural deficits within the national extension and research system and the poor farmer responsiveness of agricultural research are mentioned as major reasons for the poor success. This paper discusses different ways to make research in national agricultural research systems (NARS) more farmer-responsive. To begin with, direct and indirect benefits of successful agricultural research for consumers, producers and the state are discussed. It is explained that agricultural research can only create a positive impact when its results are adopted by the target group. Following on this, different ways are discussed to make NARS more farmer-responsive. The discussion refers to the participation of farmers in governance, financing and evaluation of agriculture research and priority setting. The advantages and disadvantages of the different mechanisms are discussed and challenges for technical assistance derived. In future, technical assistance should engage more in the strengthening smallholders' organisations. These should be supported in their efforts to acquire the technical knowledge, management skills and political influence necessary to represent the interests of smallholder farmers appropriately. A further challenge is to establish incentive systems within NARS which encourage co-operation with farmers. This would imply that the researchers' performance is measured against the relevance of their work for the target group and impact achieved at the farm level. Finally, technical assistance should concentrate on the promotion of partnerships between the different stakeholders. In this respect, NARS should be supported in their efforts to become more attractive for potential partners.},

abstract = {In many areas throughout the United States, the market value of agricultural land exceeds its use value in agricultural production. This deviation is the result of many factors, including urban influence, recreation, mineral extraction, and other natural amenities. This study examines the drivers of the nonagricultural portion of cropland and pastureland values across the United States using a rich geospatial data framework linked to the USDA's June Area Survey. The analysis suggests that many natural amenities and urban pressures shape the value of US cropland and pastureland, and that development potential is the largest driver of the nonagricultural component of farmland values.},

The scale function is easily incorporated into expenditure models, and statistical tests can be used to determine the importance of household composition in explaining household expenditure behavior.

abstract = {This study illustrates a methodology to measure empirically household food vulnerability. Food vulnerability is defined in terms of the probability now of being undernourished in the future. The empirical analysis is based on panel data from northern Mali, collected in 1997-98. Our empirical results clearly show that even though the groups of currently undernourished and food vulnerable households overlap, they are far from identical. Female-headed households appear less vulnerable to drought shocks, partly due to community solidarity. Households with good harvests are also less vulnerable, though greater dependence on agriculture attenuates this effect. Official food aid and family food gifts are important insurance mechanisms. Simulations indicate that food vulnerability can be significantly reduced through off-farm employment generation in the area and greater access to irrigation infrastructure.},

Perceptions that food is of insufficient quality (includes aspects of dietary diversity, nutritional adequacy, preference); 4.Reported reductions of food intake (for adults and children); 5.Reported consequences of reduced food intake (for adults and children); 6.Feelings of shame for resorting to socially unacceptable means to obtain food resources.},

@article{Dickau2007,
abstract = {The Central American isthmus was a major dispersal route for plant taxa originally brought under cultivation in the domestication centers of southern Mexico and northern South America. Recently developed methodologies in the archaeological and biological sciences are providing increasing amounts of data regarding the timing and nature of these dispersals and the associated transition to food production in various regions. One of these methodologies, starch grain analysis, recovers identifiable microfossils of economic plants directly off the stone tools used to process them. We report on new starch grain evidence from Panama demonstrating the early spread of three important New World cultigens: maize (Zea mays), manioc (Manihot esculenta), and arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea). Maize starch recovered from stone tools at a site located in the Pacific lowlands of central Panama confirms previous archaeobotanical evidence for the use of maize there by 7800-7000 cal BP. Starch evidence from preceramic sites in the less seasonal, humid premontane forests of Chiriqu{\'{i}} province, western Panama, shows that maize and root crops were present by 7400-5600 cal BP, several millennia earlier than previously documented. Several local starchy resources, including Zamia and Dioscorea spp., were also used. The data from both regions suggest that crop dispersals took place via diffusion or exchange of plant germplasm rather than movement of human populations practicing agriculture.},

abstract = {Based on data from Afghanistan collected prior to and during the 2007-2008 food price crisis, this paper illustrates that caloric intake is an ineffectual indicator for monitoring the onset of food insecurity. Unconditional Quantile Regression estimates indicate that the most vulnerable of households, which cannot afford to make substantial cuts to calories, exhibit no decline in caloric intake in response to increasing wheat prices. In contrast, households with high-calorie diets experience large declines. The estimates also reveal declines in dietary diversity across the entire distribution of households. The most vulnerable households may be sacrificing diet quality to maintain calories, with the potential for serious and long-term health consequences.},

ICT4D helped to mainstream ICTs into development thinking and highlight issues of access and connectivity in the developing world. However, ICT4D was mostly driven by technology hype and a narrow approach to how we use the tools. In contrast, Web 2.0 tools have a stronger focus on social and decentralised networking rather than strategic implementation. Yet key issues remain: access, connectivity, capacity-building, literacy and language. Esterhuysen argues the need to holistically appropriate, adapt and integrate these technologies in our work with people, information and technology.},

@article{Ferguson2003,
abstract = {Household surveys in developing countries often lack modules on income and ex- penditure. When included, the resulting estimates show substantial measurement error and are subject to systematic reporting biases. Indicator-based indices proposed by several analysts show much promise in circumventing these difficulties but nonetheless exhibit certain limitations. We present an alternative based on a variant of the probit model, which produces a series of indicator-specificcut-pointson a latent scale (per- manent income). These cut-points represent values above which respondents are more likely to respond affirmatively than not, and allow estimation of household permanent income when combined with an individual household's responses. This analysis com- pares estimates of permanent income using the above approach with estimates resulting from principal components analysis using household survey data from Greece, Peru and Pakistan. This new approach yields estimates of permanent income that are compara- ble with those of other methods in terms of rank correlation with reported income or expenditure, and offers the potential for substantially enhanced comparability across populations and greater precision and efficiency through item reduction methods.},

abstract = {This paper uses DOGEV model for modelling determinates of poverty in Eritrea by employing Eritrean Household Income and Expenditure Survey 1996/97 data. Education impacts welfare differently across poverty categories and there are pockets of poverty in the educated population sub group. Effect of household size is not the same across poverty categories. Contrary to the evidence in the literature the relationship between age and probability of being poor was found to be convex to the origin. Regional unemployment was found to be positively associated with poverty. Remittances, house ownership and access to sewage and sanitation facilities were found to be highly negatively related to poverty. This paper also finds out that there is captivity in poverty category and a significant correlation between poverty orderings which renders usage of standard multinomial/ordered logit in poverty analysis less defensible.},

This paper reviews the case for promoting and formalising qualitative and combined methods for impact evaluation and measuring results, as part of a broader strategy amongst donors and country partners for tackling the evaluation gap. The accompanying workshop report provides a summary of the January 2009 workshop ?Make an Impact: Tackling the ?I? and the ?D? of Making It Happen?, which aimed to familiarise DFID staff with the use of qualitative methods in impact evaluation and measuring results. The case for qualitative and combined methods is strong. Qualitative methods have an equal footing in evaluation of development impacts and can generate sophisticated, robust and timely data and analysis. Combining qualitative research with quantitative instruments that have greater breadth of coverage and generalisability can result in better evaluations that make the most of their respective comparative advantages.},

We develop a theoretical model of technology adoption and diffusion, which we then empirically apply, using duration analysis, on a micro-dataset consisting of recall data covering the period 1994–2004 for olive-producing farms from Crete, Greece. Our findings suggest that both extension services and social learning are strong determinants of technology adoption and diffusion, while the effectiveness of each of the two informational channels is enhanced by the presence of the other.

abstract = {There are a number of evolutionary features under cultivation or herd- ing by humans: (1) among major cultural developments in human evo- lution, agriculture is perhaps one of the only ones that independently originated multiple times in widely different areas; (2) a specific area within a broader center of domestication can now be proposed using sensitive molecular marker technology; (3) a shared feature among most domesticated plants is a marked genetic bottleneck; 4) the genetic archi- tecture of the domestication syndrome suggests that there was no genetic impediment to a fast domestication process (less than 100-200 generations); and (5) circumstantial evidence suggests that some species may may be more amenable to domestication than others. Further research is 1. CROP DOMESTICATION AS A LONG-TERM SELECTION EXPERIMENT 37 needed, however, to fully identify the biological features that render domestication possible. Wild-to-domesticated complexes are excellent experimental systems to investigate certain evolutionary issues. There is a known time frame extending some 10,000 years. Both the progenitors and their descendants are known. This allows the integration of evolutionary and developmental genetics and a closer look at those differences at the molecular level that are responsible for the phenotypic differences between wild and domesticated types. In the past, crop evolution has been dismissed as not typical of evolution at large, because the high level of selection pressure was thought to be unusual in natural environments. While it is true that selection in nature may operate at longer time intervals, there is now plenty of evidence that strong selection also exists in natural environments (Endler 1986; Hoekstra et al. 2001; Kingsolver et al. 2001). Thus, the study of evolution under plant cultivation or animal rearing has broader implications for the study of evolution in general. Its information is also useful to further develop crop or animal biodiversity, conservation, and breeding programs.},

abstract = {This study examines farmers' preferences for seed of new rice varieties (improved and NERICA) and their willingness to pay (WTP) for information embodied in the seed, in villages of Nigeria and Benin. Information might not generate rivalry among its users but excludability is certainly a characteristic of information and its delivery can generate incentives for private participation. Conjoint utility analysis is used to estimate the structure of farmers' preferences for rice seed. Farmers prefer one variety based on the utility they obtain from its attributes, which depends on their own social and economic characteristics. Contingent methods are used to elicit preferences and rice seed price. The marginal values of attributes are estimated with an ordered probit regression. The WTP for seed-related information is derived from the utility model. The results have implications for the best way to finance extension services in the areas of intervention, particularly for new rice varieties.},

abstract = {The adoption of liberalization measures in Kenya culminated in a rise and spread of interest rates in the financial sector. The saving rate has however remained low. Most studies have not been conclusive on factors influencing savings in developing countries. This study adopted a microeconomic approach in investigating the factors that influence savings among households of teachers, entrepreneurs and farmers in rural parts of Nakuru District. The sample composed of 359 teachers, entrepreneurs and farmers was selected through multistage sampling technique from seven rural administrative divisions of the district. Through application of least squares method the main finding was that household saving is determined by: the type of occupation, household income, age and gender of household head, level of education, dependency ratio, service charge, transport costs and credit access. The study is valuable to decision makers in financial institutions, economists and other policy makers. Generally, decision and policy makers in private, government and international institutions concerned with finance and development need to consider the effects of the above factors when making decisions concerning saving.},

Four to six months after implementation, mean daily TFV intake for adult HIP participants was 0.22 cup-equivalents higher (24{\%} higher) than for control-group SNAP participants. These impact estimates with a random-assignment research design generally agree with previously published nonexperimental elasticity estimates, which imply that a pure price reduction of 30{\%} would increase fruit and vegetable consumption by about 20{\%}.},

abstract = {A number of studies document an in-group bias in social dilemma situations. While group structure and dynamics are important in shaping in-group favouritism, less attention has been paid to individual characteristics affecting favouritism. Using data from dictator games conducted among 523 microcredit clients in Angola, this paper analyzes the effect of education on in-group favouritism. When addressing the endogeneity of education, we find that education increases in-group bias. This goes against the conventional view that education broadens the perspectives of an individual. In addition, our results suggest that in-group favouritism is related to gender, family background and access to particular forms of networks. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The increased adoption of fertilizer and improved seeds are two key aspects to raising the level of land productivity in Ethiopian agriculture. However, the adoption and diffusion of such technologies has been slow. We use data from Ethiopia between 1999–2009 to examine the role of learning from extension agents versus learning from neighbors for both improved seeds and fertilizer adoption. We combine farmers' spatial networks with panel data to identify these influences, and find that while the initial impact of extension agents was high, the effect wore off after some time, in contrast to learning from neighbors.

abstract = {The paper presents a newly compiled and improved database of national household surveys between 1988 and 2008. In 2008, the global Gini index is around 70.5 percent having declined by approximately 2 Gini points over this twenty year period. When it is adjusted for the likely under-reporting of top incomes in surveys by using the gap between national accounts consumption and survey means in combination with a Pareto-type imputation of the upper tail, the estimate is a much higher global Gini of almost 76 percent. With such an adjustment the downward trend in the Gini almost disappears. Tracking the evolution of individual country-deciles shows the underlying elements that drive the changes in the global distribution: China has graduated from the bottom ranks, modifying the overall shape of the global income distribution in the process and creating an important global "median" class that has transformed a twin-peaked 1988 global distribution into an almost single-peaked one now. The "winners" were country-deciles that in 1988 were around the median of the global incomedistribution, 90 percent of whom in terms of population are from Asia. The "losers" were the country-deciles that in 1988 were around the 85th percentile of the global income distribution, almost 90 percent of whom in terms of population are from mature economies.},

abstract = {Despite the promise of many new farm technologies, technology adoption rates in Ethiopia remain low. This paper studies the impact of social networks on technology adoption through social learning. In addition to geographic networks, intentional relationships are considered. The differential impacts by network type, technology, and asset poverty status are explored. We find evidence that although social learning occurs, it is more consistent for households not in poverty traps than for those that are persistently asset poor. Social learning among rural households is stronger for more complex technologies and is associated with intentional relationships rather than with geographic networks.},

@article{Lovo2011,
abstract = {This article analyzes the effect of entitlements from the Old Age Pension Program of South Africa on household technical efficiency using a sample of farm households in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province. The analysis is at the household level, and off-farm activities are considered as additional outputs in a nonparametric estimation of technical efficiency. This approach captures the jointness between farm and off-farm activities. The pension's effect is identified by exploiting the age-eligibility criteria in the pension program. Results show a positive effect of the pension and suggest that this large cash transfer can improve households' ability to make use of the best available technologies. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

abstract = {We compare productivity and technical efficiency of organic and conventional dairy farms in the United States. We address self-selection into organic farming by using propensity score matching and explicitly test the hypothesis that organic and conventional farms employ a single, homogeneous technology. Utilizing the 2005 Agricultural Resource Management Survey on Dairy Costs and Returns Report (ARMS) data, we reject the homogeneous technology hypothesis and find that the organic dairy technology is approximately 13{\%} less productive. However, we find little difference in technical efficiency between organic and conventional farms when technical efficiency is measured against the appropriate technology.

@article{Morduch1994,
abstract = {Vulnerability to income shocks may be intrinsically detrimental to the poor, and, just as deprivations in health and nutrition may be considered as part of an expanded poverty concept, one could also consider a measure of lack of access to consumption smoothing mechanisms. As a practical matter, this is difficult to make precise and operational. One avenue involves measuring poverty in terms of both the mean and variance of consumption over time; another possibility is to measure poverty in terms of certainty-equivalent consumption. While neither path will allow much progress given the current state of data, it should not dim the observation that, in considering risk aversion, poor households are even worse off. They not only have lower incomes than richer households, but their consumption can vary a good deal over time. Thus, vulnerability does not just result from poverty; it can also reinforce the income processes which lead to poverty and further diminish the expected welfare of the poor.},

The use of agricultural technologies determines how the increase in agricultural output impacts on poverty levels and environmental degradation. Experience and evidence from countries within and around the sub-Saharan African region indicate that returns to agricultural technology development could be very high and far reaching. The factors affecting technology adoption are assets, income, institutions, vulnerability, awareness, labour, and innovativeness by smallholder farmers. Technologies that require few assets, have a lower risk premium, and are less expensive have a higher chance of being adopted by smallholder farmers. There are certain traditional smallholder agricultural technologies in sub-Saharan Africa that also have their own merits. Some of these technologies are more efficient in their use of scarce production resources than modern technologies. Modern researchers should therefore seek to understand the rationale behind traditional smallholder farmer behaviour in technology use. This will make their future technological interventions in smallholder agriculture more effective.},

abstract = {Agriculture is unique among economic sectors in the nature of impacts from climate change. The production activity that transforms inputs into agricultural outputs involves direct use of weather inputs (temperature, solar radiation available to the plant, and precipitation). Previous studies of the impacts of climate change on agriculture have reported substantial differences in outcomes such as prices, production, and trade arising from differences in model inputs and model specification. This article presents climate change results and underlying determinants from a model comparison exercise with 10 of the leading global economic models that include significant representation of agriculture. By harmonizing key drivers that include climate change effects, differences in model outcomes were reduced. The particular choice of climate change drivers for this comparison activity results in large and negative productivity effects. All models respond with higher prices. Producer behavior differs by model with some emphasizing area response and others yield response. Demand response is least important. The differences reflect both differences in model specification and perspectives on the future. The results from this study highlight the need to more fully compare the deep model parameters, to generate a call for a combination of econometric and validation studies to narrow the degree of uncertainty and variability in these parameters and to move to Monte Carlo type simulations to better map the contours of economic uncertainty},

This paper aims to tease out how adaptation, adaptive capacity and development inter-relate, and to explore the way forward in terms of building response capacity. It is important to understand these linkages, because of the implications for poor peoples' livelihoods and the future financing of development in low income countries in the context of projected CC. Also, CC adaptation is a dynamic field of activity, with lessons emerging all the time. This paper attempts to: unpack the concepts currently underpinning CC adaptation; to conceptualise the potential responses in planned development by ‘international development actors', as opposed to development in the sense of the wider processes of social, economic and ecological change; to identify the ways forward for building response capacity in terms of governance and capacity building; identifying some of the future challenges and key questions arising.},

abstract = {Adaptation to climate change involves changes in agricultural management practices in response to changes in climate conditions. It often involves a combination of various individual responses at the farm-level and assumes that farmers have access to alternative practices and technologies available in the region. This study examines farmer adaptation strategies to climate change in Southern Africa based on a cross-section database of three countries (South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe) collected as part of the Global Environment Facility/World Bank (GEF/WB) Climate Change and African Agriculture Project. The study describes farmer perceptions to changes in long-term temperature and precipitation as well as various farm-level adaptation measures and barriers to adaptation at the farm household level. A multivariate discrete choice model is used to identify the determinants of farm-level adaptation strategies. Results confirm that access to credit and extension and awareness of climate change are some of the important determinants of farm-level adaptation. An important policy message from these results is that enhanced access to credit, information (climatic and agronomic) as well as to markets (input and output) can significantly increase farm-level adaptation. Government policies should support research and development on appropriate technologies to help farmers adapt to changes in climatic conditions. Examples of such policy measures include crop development, improving climate information forecasting, and promoting appropriate farm-level adaptation measures such as use of irrigation technologies.},

abstract = {We analyze the evolution of Sub-Saharan Africa‘s agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) over the past 40 years, looking for evidence of recent changes in growth patterns using a nonparametric Malmquist index. Our TFP estimates show a remarkable recovery in the performance of Sub-Saharan Africa‘s agriculture during between 1984 and 2003 after a long period of poor performance and decline. That recovery is the consequence of improved efficiency in production resulting from changes in the output structure and an adjustment in the use of inputs, including an overall net reduction in fertilizer use but increased fertilizer use in most of the best-performing countries. Policy changes implemented by African countries between the mid-1980s and the second half of the 1990s appear to have played an important role in improving agriculture‘s performance. As TFP growth in Sub-Saharan Africa is mainly a result of catching up to the frontier, we expect growth to slow down in the coming years unless African countries accelerate the incorporation of innovations into the production process and increase agricultural R{\&}D investment and the speed of technical change.},

The NPV for lease-managed farms is highest. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) at 10{\%} discount rate was greater than one for the three management systems, which indicates that the returns from cocoa production are high. Owner- managed farms had the highest BCR followed by lease-managed farms in that order. Lease-managed farms were more viable compared with other management systems in terms of their high NPVs. The study surmises that given the high benefits relative to costs involved in cocoa production irrespective of management system, investments in cocoa production can be increased tremendously by providing expanded access to cheap and flexible credit and land, which have presented as limiting factors in cocoa production based on the descriptive statistical analysis in the study},

Structured questionnaire was administered on 240 respondents to collect the data analysed using descriptive statistics, linear and multinomial logit regressions to examine factors that determine access and repayment of credit. The findings showed that the respondents had average family size of five, average age of 41 years, average farm size of 2.5ha and low educational background. About 62.5{\%} of the respondents obtained their credit from informal sources while 37.5{\%} patronized formal sources. The study shows that mean disbursement was N54,650 as against mean application of N61,079. Age, gender, household size, interest rate and educational level where among the factors that influence repayment capacity of vegetable farmers. It is recommended that microfinance institutions should extend credit to farmers based on need and not solely based on their technical requirements so as to ensure that the farmers are able to achieve their farm targets and hence pay back the loan.

The nonlinear forms of the model were estimated with quasi-Newton iteration technique while the linear forms were estimated with regress. The estimated coefficients conform to theoretical expectations and were appropriately signed but with few exceptions. In addition, varying elasticity of supply was also obtained. The distribution of the adjustment coefficient and the elasticity were significantly different from zero. {\textcopyright} 2010 Academic Journals.},

abstract = {The profitability, break-even point, elasticity of production, and resource use efficiency of poultry egg production by poultry egg farmers was determined in Abuja. Primary data were collected from 62 farmers drawn from the area of study by a simple random sampling technique. Analysis of data was carried out via the use of descriptive statistics, multiple regression, costs and returns analysis (budgeting), and break-even analysis. The costs and returns analysis indicated that an average farmer invested annually NGN (Nigerian naira currency) 3,504,352 (USD 1 is approximately NGN 160) in poultry egg production. The gross margin, net income, and gross return invested were NGN 10,875,663, NGN 9,798,772 and 1.72 respectively. These figures suggest that egg production in the study area was profitable. The study also showed that the break-even point for an average poultry egg farmer in Abuja was 3,978 crates of eggs per annum and the margin of safety ratio was 89 percent. In addition, the results of the study revealed that poultry egg farmers had positive, decreasing returns to scale (0.508) in egg production which indicated that poultry egg production was in the rational stage of production (Stage 2). Poultry production was profitable in Abuja but the farmers were not fully efficient in the use of their resources. To improve the profitability and resource use efficiency of poultry production, it was recommended that poultry egg farmers should implement better management practices to minimize the incidence of disease outbreaks, thereby reducing the cost of production.},

The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and stochastic profit frontier function. The results indicated the most farmers operated farm size of less than 1ha. The estimates of the stochastic profit frontier function showed that farm size increased profit while cost of fertilizer, agrochemical and farm tools increased profit. The profit inefficiency model shows that education, farming experience, extension contact and sex of the respondents are all negative coefficient, and this implies that as these variables increases the profit inefficiency of the spinach farmers decreases. Age had positive coefficient which means as the farmers' age increases the profit inefficiency of the farmers also increases, quite contrary to expectation. The most important problems encountered are lack of agrochemicals and lack of funds.},

@article{Oates2005,
abstract = {Intended for courses on theories of human development, this new text presents nine theories grouped into three major families-those that emphasize biological systems; those that emphasize environmental factors; and those that emphasize a dynamic interaction between biological and environmental forces. The nine theories selected have a long and productive history in human development and continue to evolve as a result of new insights. The inclusion of social role theory and life course theory expand the book's relevance to the study of adulthood and aging. Grouping the theories by families enhances students' ability to think critically about theoretical ideas, assess the strengths and weaknesses of each theory, and gain a deeper understanding of how each theory guides research and application. The three families are introduced with a brief overview of the unique perspectives of each theory and the rationale for grouping these theories together. Discussion of each theory includes: the historical and cultural context in which the theory was developed; an overview of key concepts and important ideas; new directions in contemporary scientific work; a research example illustrating how the theory has been tested and modified; an application showing how the theory has guided the design of an intervention or program; an analysis of how the theory answers basic questions about human development; and a critique highlighting the theories' strengths and weaknesses. Theories of Human Development serves as a text in advanced undergraduate and/or beginning graduate courses in theories of human development. Its clear organization and engaging writing style make it accessible to students with a minimal background in human development.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effects of socio-economic and demographic factors on the rate of credit allocation to the farm sector by arable crop farmers in Benue State, Nigeria. Crosssectional data were obtained from 300 randomly selected loan beneficiaries. Obtained data were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages, t-test and multiple regressions. Results showed a statistically significant gap (p ≤ 0.001) between the amount of loan applied for and the amount received by farmers. The study also found that only about 56{\%} of the loans were invested directly in farm activities implying that the balance of 43{\%} of the loan was diverted and spent on non-farm activities. Factors that significantly (p ≤ 0.005) affected the rate of credit allocation to the farm include age, education, farm size, household size, length of loan delay and visitation by bank officials. Based on these results, the paper recommends increased flow of capital to the bank for on-lending to farmers. In addition, loans should be disbursed on time and banks officials should be encouraged to pay regular supervisory visits to farmers. Finally, benefiting farmers should be given basic training on efficient management of loans in order to curtail the high rate of loan diversion.},

The idea behind the website was to harness the benefits of crowdsourcing information (using a large group of people to report on a story) and facilitate the sharing of information in an environment where rumours and uncer- tainty were dominant. At the height of the post-election violence in Kenya in late December 2007 and early January 2008, my personal blog become one of the main sources of information about the flawed electoral process and the violence that broke out thereafter.1 There was a government ban on live media and a wave of self-censorship within mainstream media, which created an information vacuum. The government argued false or biased reporting would result in even more ethnic-based violence, and that it wanted the opportunity to review media reports before they went live. In response to the ban I asked people to send me information via comments on my blog and emails about incidents of violence that they were witnessing or hearing about throughout the country, and that were not being reported by the media.},

Data collected from 100 farmers from 10 villages in 2 Local Government Areas from the zone through a multistage random sampling techniques were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Ordinary Least Square multiple regression analysis. Results revealed that farmers were on the average 47 years with fewer years of farming experience with credit use (average of 4 years). The average farm size of 3 hectares cultivated by the respondents indicate the small scale nature of their farming business. Results of multiple regression analysis showed that amount of loan obtained by farmers, years of farming experience with credit use and level of education were the major factors that positively and significantly influenced loan repayment. However, age of farmers influenced loan repayment negatively but significantly. The study recommends that for effective farm management and increase in agricultural production, further disbursement of loans should be targeted at young and better educated farmers who are more likely to adopt new innovations in agricultural production than their older counterparts.},

abstract = {The Human Development Index (HDI) uses GDP per capita to measure ``command over resources,{\{}''{\}} which implicitly makes the strong value judgment that inequality and insecurity do not matter. This paper presents revised estimates of the Index of Economic Well-Being (IEWB) for the United States. the U.K., Canada, Australia, Germany., Norway and Sweden for the period 1980 to 2001 and demonstrates that replacing an index of the log per capita incomes with our IEWB as the ``command over resources{\{}''{\}} component in the Human Development Index (HDI) affects the level and trend of the HDI, even among affluent nations. Because the IEWB recognizes four dimensions of command over resources (Current effective per capita Consumption flows, Net societal Accumulation of stocks of productive resources, Income Distribution and Economic Security), its use has a particularly large impact where underlying trends in these components diverge (e.g. the U,K. or the United States).},

This chapter provides an overview of the scale, trends and composition of intra- African trade for the period from 1996 to 2011. Due to data limitations on services and capital, the analysis focuses mainly on trade in goods. In addition, emphasis is laid on developments within the eight regional economic communities considered by the African Union as the building blocks of the future African Economic Community (AEC) as laid out in the Abuja Treaty. Table 1 shows the affiliation of each African country to the eight recognized regional economic communities1 and affiliation to various other regional communities. As is evident in the table, overlapping memberships of regional economic communities is a characteristic feature of the African regional integration process. Interestingly, Algeria, Cape Verde and Mozambique are the only African countries that are members of only one regional community.},

abstract = {This paper estimates required investment in national and international agricultural research and its allocation among different regions to maximize agricultural output gains and poverty reduction. To do this, the analysis uses a social welfare function to simulate the optimal allocation of R{\&}D investment across developing regions to (1) maximize agricultural growth or to (2) maximize poverty reduction at the global level. Due to uncertainties of parameters used, we conducted sensitivity analyses using certain statistical techniques. Our simulation results are robust for a wide range of parameters and show that to maximize agricultural output growth in developing countries, R{\&}D investment should mainly be allocated to Southeast and South Asia while to maximize poverty reduction, priority should be given to Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia},

abstract = {This paper empirically examines the impact of oil price volatility on key macroeconomic indicators of Thailand. Following Andersen et al. [2004. Analytical evaluation of volatility forecasts. International Economic Review 45(4), 1079-1110], quarterly oil price volatility is measured by using the realized volatility (RV). The impact of the oil price volatility is investigated using the vector auto-regression (VAR) system. The Granger causality test, impulse response functions, and variance decomposition show that oil price volatility has significant impact on macroeconomic indicators, such as unemployment and investment, over the period from 1993Q1 to 2006Q4. Perron's [1997. Further evidence on breaking trend functions in macroeconomic variables. Journal of Econometrics 80(2), 355-385] test identifies structural breaks in all the concerned variables during the time of the Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998). A VAR for the post-crisis period shows that the impact of oil price volatility is transmitted to budget deficit. The floating exchange rate regime introduced after the crisis may be the key contributor to this new channel of impact. Crown Copyright ?? 2008.},

@article{Rigby2001,
abstract = {There has been a concerted effort since the Rio Earth Summit to construct indicators to monitor progress towards sustainable development. This has included indicators of sustainable land management, land quality indicators and indicators of sustainable agriculture. It is argued in this paper that the design and use of such indicators can be extremely useful in that they force those involved in the discussion of sustainability to identify the key aspects of sustainable agriculture and to assign weights to them. In this process the discussion of sustainability may be coaxed from the realms of general discussion and abstraction to a more operational context, and ultimately to the discussion and classification of actual practices and farms. To this end, a farm-level indicator of agricultural sustainability, based on patterns of input use, is constructed for a sample of 80 organic and 157 conventional producers in the UK. The paper serves to highlight some of the conceptual issues, examines some of the technical issues and choices associated with indicator construction, and informs discussion of the relationship between organic production and agricultural sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The proposed methodology incorporates recent developments in the analysis of risk management. It can be applied to estimate the probability that a household or a community might fall below a critical food security threshold at some time in the future. The methodology also aims to identify the risk management strategies which are most effective in reducing the likelihood of the occurrence of food insecurity or the severity of its effects.},

@article{Shariff2008,
abstract = {This cross-sectional study assessed household food insecurity among low-income rural communities and examined its association with demographic and socioeconomic factors as well as coping strategies to minimize food insecurity. Demographic, socioeconomic, expenditure and coping strategy data were collected from 200 women of poor households in a rural community in Malaysia. Households were categorized as either food secure (n=84) or food insecure (n=116) using the Radimer/Cornell Hunger and Food Insecurity instrument. T-test, Chi-square and logistic regression were utilized for comparison of factors between food secure and food insecure households and determination of factors associated with household food insecurity, respectively. More of the food insecure households were living below the poverty line, had a larger household size, more children and school-going children and mothers as housewives. As food insecure households had more school-going children, reducing expenditures on the children's education is an important strategy to reduce household expenditures. Borrowing money to buy foods, receiving foods from family members, relatives and neighbors and reducing the number of meals seemed to cushion the food insecure households from experiencing food insufficiency. Most of the food insecure households adopted the strategy on cooking whatever is available at home for their meals. The logistic regression model indicates that food insecure households were likely to have more children (OR=1.71; p{\textless}0.05) and non-working mothers (OR=6.15; p{\textless}0.05), did not own any land (OR=3.18; p{\textless}0.05) and adopted the strategy of food preparation based on whatever is available at their homes (OR=4.33; p{\textless}0.05). However, mothers who reported to borrow money to purchase food (OR=0.84; p{\textless}0.05) and households with higher incomes of fathers (OR=0.99; p{\textless}0.05) were more likely to be food secure. Understanding the factors that contribute to household food insecurity is imperative so that effective strategies could be developed and implemented.},

@article{Takahashi2014,
abstract = {The yield potential of a set of improved rice management practices, known as the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), has attracted much attention. Yet, we know surprisingly little about SRI's impact on socio-economic outcomes, although the casual assumption abounds that higher yields imply higher income and other welfare improvements for farmers who practice SRI. Using original data from Indonesia, this study assesses the impact of SRI on farm and off-farm incomes as well as on the use of family labor time and child schooling. The matching estimator shows that SRI generates estimated yield gains of 64{\%}. However, due presumably to a significant increase in the use of family labor on farm, SRI users earn significantly lower off-farm incomes such that users enjoy no net household income gains from SRI. Despite the increased labor demand for farming, we find no evidence of a child labor effect of SRI.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to review a number of issues related to poverty, while taking stock of the ongoing research. Most of the remaining unresolved issues in poverty analysis are related directly or indirectly to the dynamics of poverty. Before the development community can become more successful in designing and implementing poverty-alleviation strategies, within the context of growth, we need to understand better the conditions under which some households remain permanently (chronically) poor and how others move in and out of poverty. In what follows we review the state of the art under a number of interrelated headings: (1) Chronic vs. transient poverty; (2) Poverty and vulnerability; (3) The determination of the poverty line across time and countries; (4) The quantitative vs. qualitative approach to poverty measurement; and (5) Growth, inequality and poverty.},

Several important targets have or will be met by 2015, assuming continued commitment by national governments, the international community, civil society and the private sector. That said, progress in many areas is far from sufficient. Redoubled efforts are urgently needed, particularly in regions most behind to jumpstart advancement and achieve maximum gains. The world community should take pride in its accomplishments thus far, while building on existing momentum to reach as many goals as possible by 2015 and to realize gains for all.},

Hedonic models are jointly estimated with water service choices using a maximum simulated likelihood approach in order to control for potential endogeneity. Findings indicate that the value of piped water depends on the type of water utility. The estimated value of municipal services is at least 15 times as much as the average water bill, while value estimates are not significant for private and community-managed systems. Value differentials are discussed considering the performance of water utilities and their institutional arrangements.},

@article{Webb2006b,
abstract = {Food insecurity is a daily reality for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Although its most extreme manifestations are often obvious, many other households facing constraints in their access to food are less identifiable. Operational agencies lack a method for differentiating households at varying degrees of food insecurity in order to target and evaluate their interventions. This chapter provides an overview of a set of papers associated with a research initiative that seeks to identify more precise, yet simple, measures of household food insecurity. The overview highlights three main conceptual developments associated with practical approaches to measuring constraints in access to food: 1) a shift from using measures of food availability and utilization to measuring "inadequate access"; 2) a shift from a focus on objective to subjective measures; and 3) a growing emphasis on fundamental measurement as opposed to reliance on distal, proxy measures. Further research is needed regarding 1) how well measures of household food insecurity designed for chronically food-insecure contexts capture the processes leading to, and experience of, acute food insecurity, 2) the impact of short-term shocks, such as major floods or earthquake, on household behaviors that determine responses to food security questions, 3) better measurement of the interaction between severity and frequency of household food insecurity behaviors, and 4) the determination of whether an individual's response to survey questions can be representative of the food insecurity experiences of all members of the household.},

@article{Weber2014,
abstract = {Recent increases in farm real estate values in the United States have increased farm equity. By exploiting periods of high and low appreciation that caused various increases in wealth for farm- ers owning various shares of their farmland, we examine whether U.S. grain farmers expanded their acres harvested or acres owned in response to an increase in their land wealth. We find that land wealth had little effect on farm size. However, for similarly-sized farms, a larger ownership share (10 percentage points) led to an increase in the growth of land owned (2 percentage points). Because older farmers own more of the land that they farm, greater land appreciation slows the rate at which younger farmers acquire land relative to older farmers.},

@article{Yehuala2008,
abstract = {In Ethiopia, among other things, lack of finance is one of the fundamental problems hampering production, productivity and income of rural farm households. Since access to institutional finance is very limited, the majority of the poor are forced to search financial services through informal channels. The study was sought to ascertain factors that affect smallholder farmer's access to formal credit and also the status of women and different wealth groups' access to formal and informal credit sources in the study area. A two stage sampling method was employed to select three out of eighteen rural peasant associations and 130 farm households. Structured interview schedule was developed, pre-tested and used for collecting quantitative data for the study from the sampled farm households. Focus group discussion, group interview and field observations were held to generate qualitative data. Descriptive statistics and logit model were used for analyzing quantitative data. The output from the study indicates that 56 (43.1{\%}) of the sampled farm households were formal credit users, whereas the remaining 74 (56.9{\%}) were non-users. It was also found out that credit access to female headed households is still limited and the difference between the wealth groups in accessing credit from the formal sources was also statistically significant. Farmers acknowledge group lending that solves the problem of collateral requirement by lending institutions, controls misuse of borrowed funds and minimizes the risk of default and they also recognize the provision of saving services by MFI, while strongly criticizing the isolation of very poor farmers from the group formation. Moreover, the smaller loan size, earlier saving requirement which was not convenient to the farmers, and repayment period by the MFI were among the critical problems. Participation in extension package programs, Experience in credit use from the formal sources, total cultivated land size, number of livestock in TLU, collateral or group formation and membership of FMSC were highly important in influencing access to formal credit use as evidenced by the model output. Therefore, policy aimed to accelerate agricultural development in the area could be successful if these factors and problems are taken into consideration to access credit from the formal financial sources.},

@article{Zilberman2014,
abstract = {This book applies rigorous economic analysis to the question of sustainable development. It considers the inter-relationship between growth and sustainability showing that one does not necessarily exist to the detriment of the other. Sustainability may be measured and defined in national accounting terms and the contributors explore a potentially powerful theoretical definition. Case studies on Morocco and China examine some of the domestic policy requirements of sustainability, revealing the desirability of quite complex combinations of policies. International policy aspects of sustainability are considered, such as technology transfers and the establishment of workable agreements to reduce global pollution. The volume demonstrates the need to build the sustainability debate on sound economic foundations, and the ability of economists to provide such foundations.},
