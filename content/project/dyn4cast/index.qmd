The package is not yet on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), if it was, it would be possible to install the released version of `Dyn4cast` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) in future. The canonical form for [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) is:

```r 
install.packages("Dyn4cast")
```

The package is in the development version on [GitHub](https://github.com/JobNmadu/Dyn4cast) but have undergone rigorous checks. So far all the functions are working perfectly well. Install it with:

```r
remotes::install_github("JobNmadu/Dyn4cast")
```
